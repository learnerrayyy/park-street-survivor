## 1. Item Management (Backpack)
Issue: The backpack interface feels repetitive or redundant when selecting core items.

Improvement: Implement Fixed Core Slots.

Solution: Lock the two mandatory items in place by default. This reduces cognitive load and clicks, allowing the user to focus exclusively on selecting optional power-ups or strategic items.

## 2. Onboarding & Guidance (Tutorial)
Issue: New players lack direction and don't understand game mechanics.

Improvement: Introduce an Integrated Tutorial & Glossary.

Solution: Add a "How to Play" overlay at the start of the first session. Include a visual encyclopedia (Tooltips or a Help Page) that clearly defines the effects of power-ups and the threats posed by specific obstacles.

## 3. Narrative Pacing (Dialogs)
Issue: Large amounts of text can frustrate players who prefer action over story.

Improvement: Add a Global "Skip" Function.

Solution: Place a "Skip" or "Fast-Forward" button in the corner of dialog sequences. This empowers the user with control over their pace while keeping the script available for story-driven players.

## 4. UI Clarity (Dialog Interface)
Issue: The purpose or flow of the dialog page is currently ambiguous.

Improvement: Refine Text Hierarchy and Placement.

Solution: Standardize the dialog UI by placing a dedicated text box at the bottom of the screen. Use a "Tap to Continue" indicator (like a blinking arrow) to signal that there is more text, making the interaction intuitive.
